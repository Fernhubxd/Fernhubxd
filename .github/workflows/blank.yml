# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Set up Node.js environment
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      # Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Run tests
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      # Example deployment step (customize for your needs)
      # Uncomment and configure the following lines if you have deployment steps
      # - name: Deploy
      #   run: |
      #     echo Deploying your project...
      #     # Add deployment commands here

      # Example of running a one-line script
      - name: Run a one-line script
        run: echo Hello, world!

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: Run a multi-line script
        run: |
          echo Add other actions to build,
          echo test, and deploy your project.
```

### Explanation of the Steps:
1. **actions/checkout@v4**: Checks out your repository so that the job can access it.
2. **actions/setup-node@v3**: Sets up the Node.js environment, specifying the version of Node.js you want to use.
3. **Install dependencies**: Runs `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
4. **Run tests**: Runs `npm test` to execute your test suite.
5. **Deploy**: This is an example deployment step that is currently commented out. You can customize this section based on your deployment process.
6. **Run a one-line script**: Prints "Hello, world!" to the console.
7. **Run a multi-line script**: Prints additional messages to the console.

You can adjust the Node.js version, add other setup steps, or include more specific deployment instructions as needed for your project.
